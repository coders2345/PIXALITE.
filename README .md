## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to deploy and run the NFT marketplace on your local or desired environment. Follow the deployment section for detailed instructions.

## Features

- Creation, ownership, and trading of NFTs
- Bidding functionality for NFTs
- Buying NFTs
- Wallet integration

## Dependencies
- connect with server check the rootstock folder

- geth and remix and java8 use for create a local node

-RSK node use for this project

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager): Install Node.js and npm on your machine to manage packages and run JavaScript code.

- RootStack SDK: Utilize the RootStack SDK to interact with the RootStack network. Install it using the following command:
  ```
  npm install @rootstack/web3deploy
  ```

- Solidity Compiler (solc): You'll need the Solidity compiler to compile your smart contracts. You can install it using various methods, such as using the solc npm package or the Solidity compiler provided by Truffle.

- Web3.js library: If you plan to interact with the RootStack network through a web application, you might consider using the Web3.js library. Install it using the following command:
  ```
  npm install web3
  ```

- OpenZeppelin Contracts: If you are using any OpenZeppelin contracts, you can install them using the following command:
  ```
  npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
  ```

## Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the NFT marketplace:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure the marketplace settings and smart contracts as per your requirements.
4. Compile the smart contracts using the Solidity compiler.
5. Deploy the smart contracts to the RootStack network using the RootStack SDK.
6. Once the deployment is successful, note down the deployed contract addresses and other relevant information.

## Interacting with the Marketplace

Once the NFT marketplace is deployed, users can interact with it in the following ways:

### Minting NFTs

Users can mint their own NFTs using the provided minting functionality. See the `minting.sol` and `minting.js` files for details.

### Bidding on NFTs

Users can place bids on NFTs listed in the marketplace. Refer to the `bidding.sol` and `bidding.js` files for more information.

### Buying NFTs

Users can directly purchase NFTs listed for sale in the marketplace. Check out the `buying.sol` and `buying.js` files for implementation details.

### Wallet Integration

Users can connect their wallets, check balances, and sign transactions for buying or bidding. Take a look at the `wallet_integrate.js` file for guidance.

### User Authentication

Implementing user authentication in an NFT marketplace using RootStack involves creating the necessary routes, controllers, and middleware to handle user registration, login, and authentication. Refer to the `user_authentication.js` file for a code snippet example.

### Transaction Processing

Implementing transaction processing in an NFT marketplace involves creating routes, controllers, and database operations to handle the creation and management of transactions. See the `transaction_processing.js` file for an example implementation.

### Wallet Creation in RootStack

Users can create a wallet in RootStack. Review the `wallet_create.js` file for an example implementation.

Please refer to the specific files mentioned above for detailed code snippets and implementation guidance.
